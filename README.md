Loan Prediction System
Overview
The Loan Prediction System is a machine learning-based application designed to assist financial institutions in predicting whether a loan application should be approved or not. By leveraging historical data, the system analyzes various attributes of loan applicants and provides a predictive outcome, enhancing decision-making efficiency.

Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, and scales numerical features.
Model Training and Evaluation: Utilizes machine learning algorithms like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost for prediction.
Interactive Dashboard (Optional): Displays key insights and prediction outcomes.
Customizable: Easily extendable to accommodate new features or datasets.
